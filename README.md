CALCULA. is a free open source calculator, it is in super early stages and it is been maintened with the purpose of easy to read, commented and FTM (free to modify) code

It was created by me! (Gabriel M. Chiapetti) It uses the Python programming language and currently time imports (it is super easy to work on).

But remember: The programmer of the script is still learning programming and it would be super nice if you contribute to it too!

Feel free to add, remove, sugest or even make your own version of CALCULA.!

It is completely FTM and open source!

Thx!!1!!!1! (I have a lot of sense of humor btw xD)
